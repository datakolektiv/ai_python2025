    "* **`temperature`**\n",
    "  This parameter controls how *random or deterministic* the model’s token-sampling is. At a low temperature (closer to 0), the model becomes very deterministic, tending to pick the highest-probability next tokens consistently. At a higher temperature (closer to 1 or above, depending on model) the probability distribution of possible next tokens is flattened, meaning tokens with lower original probabilities become more likely to be sampled. \n",
    "\n",
    "  From the OpenAI docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  > “What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`top_p`** (also known as *nucleus sampling*)\n",
    "  This parameter sets a threshold on *cumulative probability mass* of tokens to consider. Rather than scaling all probabilities (as temperature does), you sort possible next tokens by their probability, then include the smallest set whose combined probability is ≥ `top_p`. The next token is sampled from that subset. So if `top_p = 0.9`, you consider the tokens that together account for 90 % of the probability mass and ignore the rest (lowest-probability tokens).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Differences and Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mechanism**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `temperature` adjusts *how flat or peaked* the probability distribution of next tokens is.\n",
    "  * `top_p` restricts the *space of possible next tokens* to the most probable subset (cumulative mass) and discards the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effect on output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A *low* `temperature` tends to yield more predictable, consistent, and “safe” output.\n",
    "  * A *high* `temperature` yields more varied, creative, and risk-taking output.\n",
    "  * A *low* `top_p` (e.g., 0.1–0.3) restricts the token selection drastically → very focused/deterministic output.\n",
    "  * A *high* `top_p` (e.g., 0.8–1.0) allows a broader set of token choices → more diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When to use which**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If you want **maximum control** and deterministic output (e.g., factual answers, code generation, tables) → use low `temperature` (maybe ~0–0.3) and/or low `top_p`.\n",
    "  * If you want **creativity, variety, open-ended responses** (e.g., story generation, brainstorming) → use higher `temperature` (e.g., 0.7–1.0) and/or higher `top_p`.\n",
    "  * Many developers follow the guideline: **use one of them**, not both aggressively. As the docs note:\n",
    "\n",
    "    > “We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **`temperature`** to **scale the randomness** of token selection (how adventurous the model is).\n",
    "* Use **`top_p`** to **limit the pool** of token candidates (how many possible next tokens the model may consider).\n",
    "* Both influence **diversity vs. determinism** of output, but they do so via different mechanisms.\n",
    "* For many use cases, adjusting **one** of them is sufficient (and simpler) rather than tweaking both simultaneously."
